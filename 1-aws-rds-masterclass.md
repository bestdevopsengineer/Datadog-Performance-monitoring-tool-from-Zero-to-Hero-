# What is an Application Performance Management?
collects metrics data from your applications and  this data helps to monitor application insights, so we can:

1-improve performance
2-improve user experience
3-reduce issues and errors


## APM helps to monitor all key aspects of your project

1-Front End
2-Back end
3-Infrastructure

### How is APM monitoring performed?
from our project/service/website APM collect  [metrics/events/logs/traces] or MELT  
with these data to:
1- gain insights from the user perspective
2-quickly spot performance trends at a glance
3-root cause analysis
4-generate alerts on anomalies
5-tracks individual SQL statements
6-monitor key performance indicators such as: response time/ error rate / resource usage / latency

### Four Golden Signals of Monitoring

1-latency (time required to fulfil a request)
2-traffic (number of hits per sec)
3-saturation (% of resources consumed)
4-errors (request failures rates)
